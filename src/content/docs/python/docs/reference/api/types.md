# Types

Detailed API documentation for Genkit Python types is generated separately. Please refer to the specific class or type documentation as needed.

*(Note: The original MkDocs configuration used `mkdocstrings` to auto-generate content here. A different approach is needed for Starlight, such as linking to externally generated documentation or using a custom Astro component if available.)*
